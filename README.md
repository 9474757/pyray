I'm creating this repository in January 2018 and it is crazy that the best open source option for rendering 3d scenes remains POV ray.
Now, POV ray is a great program, but why can't we have that functionality in Python, a language that is perhaps the most widely used and only growing in popularity?
This code is a first step towards that goal - have the ability to do everything POV ray does and more with plain, vanilla Python.
While there certainly is a very long way to go before this can be a reality, it certainly won't happen without taking a first step. And of course, I could use help :)

Above all else, I want to value simplicity in this library. Minimize the dependence on external libraries so more people can hit the ground running with it and avoid complexity when simplicity will do just fine.


So far, I've been using this to create YouTube videos for my channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd2Boc12Ora42VIJBULz0kA).

Here are some that demonstrate the abilities of this code -
