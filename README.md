# Introduction

I'm creating this repository in January 2018 and it is crazy that the best open source option for rendering 3d scenes remains POV ray.
Now, POV ray is a great program, but why can't we have that functionality in Python, a language that is perhaps the most widely used and only growing in popularity?
This code is a first step towards that goal - have the ability to do everything POV ray does and more with plain, vanilla Python.
While there certainly is a very long way to go before this can be a reality, it certainly won't happen without taking a first step. And of course, I could use help :)

Above all else, I want to emphasize simplicity in this library and minimize the dependence on external libraries so more people can hit the ground running with it.


# Demonstrations
So far, I've been using this to create YouTube videos for my channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd2Boc12Ora42VIJBULz0kA).

Here are some that demonstrate the abilities of this code - 

Binomial coefficients on hypercubes.

# Usage
To keep things simple, the program simply writes an image or a series of images to the folder ./Images/RotatingCube (this was the first object that was animated with this tool).

To use it, you can simply run any method tagged @MoneyShot.
